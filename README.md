## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) running locally or on your network
- FFmpeg (auto-downloaded during setup)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/homestream.git
cd homestream

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run setup (creates database, admin user, SSL certs, downloads FFmpeg)
npm run setup

# 4. Start the server
npm start
```

Open `https://localhost:3000` in your browser (accept the self-signed certificate).

To access from other devices on your network, use your machine's local IP: `https://192.168.x.x:3000`

## Configuration

All settings are in `.env` (created during setup):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | `postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mediaserver` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | _(auto-generated)_ | Secret key for JWT tokens |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTPS server port |
| `MEDIA_DIR` | `./media` | Path to your media folders |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | `5120` | Max upload file size in MB |
| `MAX_FILES_PER_UPLOAD` | `500` | Max files per upload batch |
| `JWT_EXPIRY` | `24h` | Token expiration time |
| `SOFT_DELETE_DAYS` | `30` | Days before trashed files are permanently deleted |

## Usage

### Adding Media

Drop any folder containing images or videos into the `media/` directory (or your configured `MEDIA_DIR`). HomeStream detects changes automatically — no restart needed.

## Security Notice

> **HomeStream is designed for local network (LAN) use only. Exposing it to the public internet is at your own risk.**

If you still plan to make it publicly accessible, do so at your own risk.

| Risk | Details | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **No rate limiting** | Login and API endpoints have no request throttling. An attacker can brute-force passwords. | Add a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) with rate limiting, or use a module like `express-rate-limit`. |
| **Self-signed certificates** | Browsers will show warnings. Not trusted by external clients. | Use a proper TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt (free) behind a reverse proxy. |
| **No file type validation on upload** | Any file type can be uploaded. A malicious user with upload access could upload harmful files. | Restrict uploads to known media MIME types if exposed publicly. |
| **Token in URL** | Media streaming passes JWT tokens as query parameters, which can appear in server logs and browser history. | Acceptable on LAN; on public internet, use cookie-based auth or signed URLs with short expiry. |
| **No CSP headers** | Content Security Policy is disabled to allow inline styles. Increases XSS risk. | Enable CSP with a strict policy if facing the internet. |
| **No account lockout** | Failed login attempts are not tracked. No lockout after repeated failures. | Implement account lockout or CAPTCHA for public-facing deployments. |

**Our recommendation:** If you need external access, put HomeStream behind a **VPN** (WireGuard, Tailscale) rather than exposing it directly. This gives you remote access with LAN-level security — no extra hardening needed.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (dark theme, responsive)
- **Auth:** bcrypt + JWT
- **Thumbnails:** Sharp (images), FFmpeg (videos)
- **File Watching:** Chokidar
